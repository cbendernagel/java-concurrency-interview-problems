## Questions

1. Thread Creation: Implement a program that creates multiple threads using the Thread class or Runnable interface. Demonstrate starting and managing these threads.

2. Synchronization: Write code to demonstrate synchronization using the synchronized keyword or synchronized blocks/methods to access shared resources safely among multiple threads.

3. Producer-Consumer Problem: Solve the classic producer-consumer problem using threads and synchronization mechanisms like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

4. Concurrency Utilities: Implement a scenario using concurrent utilities such as CountDownLatch, Semaphore, or CyclicBarrier to coordinate the execution of multiple threads.

5. Locks and Conditions: Use explicit locks (ReentrantLock) and conditions (Condition) to implement a multithreaded program with fine-grained control over thread synchronization.

6. Thread Pools: Implement a program that utilizes thread pools (ExecutorService) to execute multiple tasks concurrently while managing thread creation and recycling.

7. Atomic Variables: Demonstrate the use of atomic variables (AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean, etc.) to perform thread-safe operations without explicit synchronization.

8. Callable and Future: Write code using Callable and Future to execute tasks asynchronously and retrieve results or handle exceptions from parallel computations.

9. Concurrent Collections: Use concurrent collections such as ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, or CopyOnWriteArrayList to safely manipulate shared data across multiple threads.

10. Race Conditions and Deadlocks: Discuss and write code snippets illustrating race conditions, potential deadlock scenarios, and ways to prevent or mitigate these issues in concurrent programs.
